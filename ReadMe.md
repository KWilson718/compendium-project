# Personal Note Compendium Creation Tool

## Purpose

After gathering notes in multitudes of formats throughout years of academic studies, I have realized that there is great value to a condensed collection of all key data learned throughout said experience. Despite being decent at the note taking itself, I can greatly benefit from creating a compendium of information so that all critical information is in one standardized location. 

Looking for projects to continue learning about data flow, the concept of creating a service to create and organize this idea proved to be of interest. This project should allow for one to compile various notes together & format everything together. 

## To Run Project

- clone the repo
- open the folder in a terminal
- ```npm install``` to install packages
- ```npm run start``` to open

## Technologies Used

- Electron Forge (Vite Template)

- TailwindCSS

## Current Work

Currently, the basic file structure is being worked on, with direct focus being on the overarching data schema. Most of the major concepts have been ironed out, with implementation coming in the near future.
