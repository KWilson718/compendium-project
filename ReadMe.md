# Personal Note Compendium Creation Tool

## Purpose

After gathering notes in multitudes of formats throughout years of academic studies, I have realized that there is great value to a condensed collection of all key data learned throughout said experience. Despite being decent at the note taking itself, I can greatly benefit from creating a compendium of information so that all critical information is in one standardized location. 

Looking for projects to continue learning about data flow, the concept of creating a service to create and organize this idea proved to be of interest. This project should allow for one to compile various notes together & format everything together.
